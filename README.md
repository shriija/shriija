# 👋 Hi, I'm Shrija Gangapuram

### 🚀 3rd Year CSE Student | Design-Driven Developer | Creative Technologist

I'm a Computer Science student who loves **technical logic** almost as much as **pixel perfection**. I spend my time bridging the gap between a Figma file and a Functional codebase-and occasionally wrestling with LeetCode.

### 🛠️ What I'm Building & Learning

- 💻 **Web Development:** Crafting beautiful, responsive, and user-centric websites using **HTML/CSS**, **JS**, and **Python**. Currently divibg deep into the **MERN Stack**
- 🕹️ **Game Development:** Exploring the mechanics **Pixel Art** via **Unity (C#)** and **Godot**.
- 🎨 **Design Engineering:** Bridging the gap between a **Figma** prototype and a functional product.

### 📈 GitHub Exploration
*This profile serves as a living documentation of my journey from CSE student to Creative Engineer.*

- 🎯 **The DSA Grind:** Attempting to maintain a **LeetCode streak**. (At least, that’s the plan... check back tomorrow to see if I survived.)
- 🔭 **The Goal:** Finding a place where **clean code** and **intentional design** actually coexist.
- 🌱 **Learning in Public:** Documenting my shift into deep technical work, one pixel (and bug) at a time.
- 🎥 **Side Quest:** Minimal video editing for project demos—mostly because I like things to look pretty.
